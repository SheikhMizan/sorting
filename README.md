# Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms. Sorting algorithms are used to arrange elements in a specific order, typically in ascending or descending order. Each algorithm has its own advantages and performance characteristics, and understanding them can be useful in programming and algorithm design.

## Algorithms Included

The following sorting algorithms are/will be implemented in this repository:

1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort
6. Heap Sort
7. Counting Sort
8. Radix Sort
9. Bucket Sort
10. Shell Sort

## Implementation Details

The implementations are provided in various programming languages, allowing developers to choose their preferred language or explore different implementations. Currently, the following programming languages are supported:

- Python
- Java
- C++
- JavaScript

For each algorithm, the repository provides a separate file or module containing the implementation along with a sample input to demonstrate the algorithm's functionality. The code is well-commented to enhance understanding and readability.

## How to Use

To use any of the sorting algorithms, locate the respective implementation file in the preferred programming language. Each file contains a function or method that accepts an array or list of elements as input and sorts them in place. You can call this function from your own code or execute the provided sample input to see the algorithm in action.

Feel free to modify the code or integrate it into your projects as needed. You can also contribute to this repository by adding additional implementations or improving existing ones. Please follow the guidelines mentioned in the repository for contributions.

## Performance and Complexity Analysis

Each sorting algorithm has its own time complexity and performance characteristics. The repository includes detailed explanations of the time and space complexity for each algorithm, allowing you to make informed decisions based on your specific requirements. Understanding these complexities is crucial when dealing with large datasets or time-sensitive applications.
